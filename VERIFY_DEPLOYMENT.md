# ✅ Deployment Verification

## What I Just Did
1. ✅ Rebuilt the app with correct base path
2. ✅ Redeployed to GitHub Pages

## Test These URLs

After waiting 1-2 minutes, try these direct links:

### Main App:
https://johnalansheppard.github.io/Drunk-O-Meter/

### Test JavaScript File (should load):
https://johnalansheppard.github.io/Drunk-O-Meter/assets/index-DkDePEXr.js

### Test CSS File (should load):
https://johnalansheppard.github.io/Drunk-O-Meter/assets/index-DzrBOns5.css

## If Still Getting 404

1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** - GitHub Pages needs time to rebuild
2. **Hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. **Clear browser cache**: Settings → Clear browsing data
4. **Check GitHub Pages settings**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/JohnAlanSheppard/Drunk-O-Meter/settings/pages
   - Verify: Branch = `gh-pages`, Folder = `/ (root)`

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ JavaScript file URL should show code (not 404)
- ✅ CSS file URL should show styles (not 404)
- ✅ Main page should load the app (not blank)

If the direct asset URLs work but the main page doesn't, it's a different issue. Let me know!
